title: Captain's Challenge Day 1
---
I have been plantstrong for 28 months now.
This month Whole Foods is sponsoring a national Engine 2 Diet 28 day challenge.
I decided to do the captain's challenge.
I eat mainly a fire chief diet right now.
The differences aren't huge.
I will not be using any tofu, tempeh, almond/soy milks, walnuts, avocados, crackers, breads.
The main thing I will be eliminating is sodium.
Here are the rules.

What to Eat:  
Vegetables: ANY, frozen or fresh. Including all starchy vegetables.  
Fruit: Any, frozen or fresh.  
Whole INTACT grains: Brown rice, oats, quinoa, barley (and other whole grains).  
Beans and Lentils: Whole, no salt added.  
Spices and Condiments: Any and all that you like (no/low salt added).  
Polenta: Whole corn polenta.  
Whole Grain Pasta: As long as it is with LARGE amounts of veggies! 75% veggies, 25% pasta.

Things to avoid while you are a captain:  
Animal products.  
Oil.  
Coffee.  
Coconut.  
High fat plant-foods including: avocado, tofu, tempeh, olives, nuts, seeds, non-dairy milk, nut butter.  
Salt: Avoid things like miso, soy sauce, tamari. Instead use lots of spices, low sodium condiments when possible.  
Smoothies or Juices.  
Bread, crackers, tortilla chips, rice cakes, cereal.  
Baked goods.  
Added sugar/sweeteners: Keep to no more than 1-2 tbs extracted sweetener per day.  
Dried fruit.

Today went great.
I wasn't really hungry enough for a dinner so I counted my snacks as dinner.
I know the hardest part is going to be watching out for the sodium.
I have taken my salt container away from beside the stove to up in a cabinet.
I had my sushi without soy sauce or tamari today.
It tastes a lot different that way, but it was still really good.
